  IFNULL(SUM(erp.`payment`), 0) AS total_payment

this is okay but expenses is zero if payment is not received:

SELECT 
  IFNULL(SUM(ex.`amount`), 0) AS total_expenses, 
  IFNULL(SUM(erp.`payment`), 0) AS total_payment,
  SUM(p.`id`)
FROM 
  `expenses` ex 
  JOIN `expense_reports` er 
    ON er.`id` = ex.`expense_report_id` 
  LEFT JOIN `expense_report_payment` erp 
    ON erp.`expense_report_id` = er.`id` 
  JOIN `payments` p 
    ON p.`id` = erp.`payment_id` AND p.`deleted_at` IS NULL AND p.`cancelled_at` IS NULL AND p.`received_at` IS NOT NULL 
WHERE ex.`deleted_at` IS NULL 
  AND er.`deleted_at` IS NULL 
  AND er.`rejected_at` IS NULL 
  AND er.`cancelled_at` IS NULL
